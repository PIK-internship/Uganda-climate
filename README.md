This repository contains the R notebooks used to derive the following climate indices for Uganda:
- mean annual and monthly temperature and precipitation
- extreme temperatures (hot days and nights)
- extreme precipitation (heavy rainfall, droughts)

The visualizations include maps with customized administrative units, climate graphs after Walter and Lieth, as well as SPEI-12. 

The datasets used: daily and monthly historic (1979-2019) and daily data from 2019 to 2100 for ssp126 and ssp370 climate scenarios. 

The code was produced during the internship at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact (PIK), AGRICA project.It is free to be used and reused.
